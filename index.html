      <h2>Submit a Complaint</h2>
      <p>Anjouan Licensing Services Inc. should only be contacted by players when they believe an Operator is in breach of their license. All disputes with an Operator about a payout, a blocked account, a delay, broken features and so on, should first be taken up directly with the Operator. If no resolution is found, there are a number of independent bodies you can contact, which should be listed on the Operator website. If, however, the complaint relates to an Operator breaching their license, you can contact Anjouan Licensing Services Inc. directly via their Player Support channel or via the "File a Complaint" button below.</p>
      <p>You must include all of the details of your grievance so they can investigate fully. All disputes must be recorded in writing via email so the complaint is correctly recorded.</p>
